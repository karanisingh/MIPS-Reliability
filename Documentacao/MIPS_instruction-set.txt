Instructions are divided into three types:

R, I and J. Every instruction starts with a 6-bit opcode.

In addition to the opcode, R-type instructions specify three registers, a shift amount field, and a function field;

I-type instructions specify two registers and a 16-bit immediate value;

J-type instructions follow the opcode with a 26-bit jump target


Type  -31-												-0-

R	opcode(6)	rs(5)	rt(5)	rd(5)	shamt(5)	funct(6)

I	opcode(6)	rs(5)	rt(5)	imediate(16)

J	opcode(6)	address(26)

** MIPS assembly language

These are assembly language instructions that have direct hardware implementation,
as opposed to pseudoinstructions which are translated into multiple real instructions before being assembled.
In the following, the register letters d, t, and s are placeholders for (register) numbers or register names.
C denotes a constant (immediate).

** Integer

MIPS has 32 integer registers.
Data must be in registers to perform arithmetic.
Register $0 always holds 0 and register $1 is normally reserved for the assembler (for handling pseudo instructions and large constants).
