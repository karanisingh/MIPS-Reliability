For this second part of the work, we chose to create an independent program,
 opting to reuse the binary file parser structure and identification
 of the functions.

We created 3 major structures:

*InstructionMemory
*RegisterFile
*DataMemory

We chose to leave the instructions already properly written within the algorithm (hardcoded)

DataMemory already started with some pre-established values.

At the end of the instruction cycle, we check the values ​​present in the memories and check
whether all instructions were executed correctly.

We use the DataPath present on page 307 of the 3rd edition of the book for reference.
